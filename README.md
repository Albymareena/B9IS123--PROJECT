(MILMA) short for the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF)

A big family of dairy farmers in Kerala who work together to collect, process, and sell milk and milk products.
Milma (Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation â€“ KCMMF) came into existence in 1980 under the Operation Flood, National Dairy Programme. It is a three-tiered co-operative organisation for the socio-economic development of milkmen of Kerala. With over 10.6 lakh farmer members via 3,102 milk cooperatives (as of March 2024), Milma operates on the lines of three regional unions: TRCMPU (Thiruvananthapuram), ERCMPU (Ernakulam), and MRCMPU (Malabar). Having its headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram, it is tasked with procuring, processing, and distributing milk and milk products fortified with vitamin A across the state. Milma was responsible for making Kerala self-sufficient in milk production and still maintains close connections to national and state-level dairy and livestock development organizations.

A Milma society is a small, local group of dairy farmers in a village. These farmers collect milk every day, test it for quality, and send it to Milma for processing. In return, they get paid fairly and regularly. These village societies are the heart of the entire Milma system.Right now, there are more than 3,100 such societies all across Kerala, with over 1 million+ farmers as members.
