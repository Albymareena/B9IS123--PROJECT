Milma, short for the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF)

a big family of dairy farmers in Kerala who work together to collect, process, and sell milk and milk products.



A Milma society is a small, local group of dairy farmers in a village. These farmers collect milk every day, test it for quality, and send it to Milma for processing. In return, they get paid fairly and regularly. These village societies are the heart of the entire Milma system.

Right now, there are more than 3,100 such societies all across Kerala, with over 1 million+ farmers as members.
